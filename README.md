ü´Å Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Analysis

üéØ Project Overview: Unmasking the Predictors

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of survey data to predict lung cancer risk and identify the most significant contributing factors. Our goal is to transform raw data on symptoms and habits (Smoking, Fatigue, Chest Pain, etc.) into clear, actionable insights using machine learning and rigorous statistical methods.

The ultimate aim is to determine which factors are the strongest, independent predictors of a positive lung cancer diagnosis within the surveyed population.

üöÄ Key Highlights & Results

(Once you complete your analysis, replace these placeholders with your actual, punchy findings!)

Metric / Finding

Value

Significance

Model Accuracy

98.7% (Support Vector Machine)

High performance achieved in classifying patients.

Top Predictor

Shortness of Breath

The single most impactful feature for predicting a positive diagnosis.

Data Imbalance

90% YES vs 10% NO

Addressed using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

Age Correlation

Average diagnosis age: 63.5

Confirmed a strong concentration of diagnoses in the older age group.

üí° We successfully created a highly accurate classification model, but the key value lies in the Feature Importance‚Äîhighlighting the physical symptoms that warrant immediate medical attention.

üìÇ Project Structure & Workflow

The analysis is broken down into two main phases, documented in their respective files:

Data_Preparation_and_EDA.ipynb

Cleaning & Encoding: Handling missing values and converting categorical text (GENDER, LUNG_CANCER) and binary numbers (1, 2) into usable formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, finding correlations (e.g., using a heatmap), and checking for data balance/imbalance.

Modeling_and_Prediction.ipynb

Preprocessing: Scaling features and handling class imbalance (e.g., using SMOTE).

Model Training: Implementing and comparing various classifiers (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

ü§ù Next Steps & Contributions

I'm always looking to refine the model! Future improvements could include:

Deep Learning: Implementing a basic Neural Network to see if we can push accuracy higher.

Time Series: If available, incorporating longitudinal data to analyze risk changes over time.

Explainable AI (XAI): Using SHAP or LIME to better explain individual model predictions.
